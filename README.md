 I am an extremely motivated Physical Design Engineer with interests in the field of Digital IC Design and Computer Architecture. I am regularly trusted to deliver on the toughest designs because I enjoy finding new approaches and I do not give up!

Besides the cutting-edge technology and tools I work with every day, I believe the best thing is the people! I enjoy learning from experienced Engineers. My objective is simple, work with my team to deliver continued success, and to keep learning Physical Design!

My area of interest lies in ASIC design, Timing analysis(STA), Physical Design, and Logic Synthesis
